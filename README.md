## Why used json-server?

- It's simple and easy to use.
- It provides a realistic simulation of a RESTful API server with minimal setup

## Notes

As I have primarily worked with Next.js recently, this was my first experience using Vite.
While this led to some additional time spent on project setup, it was a valuable learning experience that helped me understand the differences between these build tools.
Vite's fast development server and build performance were particularly impressive.
